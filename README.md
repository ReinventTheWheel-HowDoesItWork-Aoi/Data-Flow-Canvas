## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Privacy First
- **100% client-side processing** — All data transformation and analysis happens in your browser using WebAssembly
- **Your data stays local** — CSV files and pipeline data are processed entirely in your browser and never uploaded to any server
- **No account required** — Open the app and start building immediately, no sign-up needed

### 🎨 Visual Pipeline Builder
- **Drag-and-drop interface** — Build pipelines visually with React Flow
- **303 block types** — Data input (3), transformation (86), analysis (142), visualization (70), and export (2)
- **Real-time preview** — See data changes as you build

### 🐍 Python Powered
- **Pyodide integration** — Full Python data science stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) running in WebAssembly
- **No installation** — Everything runs in your browser

### 🌍 Internationalization
- **Multi-language support** — Available in English and Japanese
